# geoseismic-explorer

# A Laravel web application for visualising seismic events using USGS realtime feeds. Earthwuakes can't be predicted,     eventhough it can be recorded and used for further investigations. This is a simple application which displays Epicenter, Magnitude, Longitude, Latitude, Depth and IST(Indian Standard time). This is an experimental project before creating an application for recoding seismic events in Idukki District.
